<h3>Flistify</h3>
<p>
    A script to bulk-resize images for an f-list gallery, using python and imagemagick.

<h3>Braceless Javascript</h3>
<p>
    A couple of short programs written in a subset of javascript. Specifically, javascript but you can't use anything with curly braces in it, like 'if' or 'for'. Instead, ternaries and lambdas give you all the flow control you need. Has a lispy flavor.
